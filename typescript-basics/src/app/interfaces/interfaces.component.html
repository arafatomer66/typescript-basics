TypeScript interfaces provide a powerful
way to define object structures and
ensure type safety.
Interfaces define the structure of an
object by specifying the names and types
of its properties.
We declare an interface using the
interface keyword in a .ts file. You can also
create interface inside your component
file with .tsx extension.
