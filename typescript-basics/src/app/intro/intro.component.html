TypeScript follows the same rules as
JavaScript for variable declarations.

Variables can be declared using: var, let,
and const.

var: Older variable declaration keyword in
JavaScript.

Hoisting: Variables declared with var are
moved to the top of their scope during
the compilation phase.

let: Introduces block-scoping and declares
an immutable variable.

const: Declares an immutable variable and
preferred for most cases in TypeScript.
